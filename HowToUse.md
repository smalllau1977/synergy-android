First, run the Synergy server on your computer.  Then, connect your device to the same network (Either by WiFi, USB Tether, or Bluetooth tether.  Typically, WiFi is used.)  Finally, enter in your computer's IP address and the port Synergy is running on.  The app will do the rest, and minimize itself to the background so you can use the phone normally.

NONE OF THIS WORKS YET.  I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS YET.  HOPEFULLY IT WILL WORK IN THE FUTURE.
